# INFO 5940 
Welcome to the INFO 5940 repository. You will complete your work using [**GitHub Codespaces**](#about-github-codespaces) and save your progress in your own GitHub repository. This guide will walk you through setting up the development environment and running the test notebook.  

## Getting Started 

### Step 1: Fork this repository 
1. Click the **Fork** button (top right of this page).
2. This will create a copy of the repo under **your own GitHub account**.

Forking creates a personal copy of the repo under **your** GitHub account.  
- You can commit, push, and experiment freely.  
- Your work stays separate from the official class materials.

### Step 2: Open your forked repo Codespace
1. Go to **your forked repo**.
2. Click the green **Code** button and switch to the **Codespaces** tab.  
3. Select **Create Codespace**.
4. Wait a few minutes for the environment to finish setting up.

### Step 3: Verify your environment 
Once the Codespace is ready: 
1. If you are in `<your-file-name>.ipynb` in your codespace.
2. Install the Python 3.11.13 Kernel.  In the top-right corner, click **Select Kernel**.
    1. If **Install/Enable suggested extensions Python + Jupyter** appears, select it, and wait for the install to finish before moving on to the next step.
    2. Select **Python Environments** choose **Python 3.11.13 (first option)**.
3. Run the code block to check your setup. 

## About GitHub Codespaces

[Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces) is a complete software development and execution environment, running in the cloud, with its primary interface being a VSCode instance running in your browser.

Codespaces is not free, but their per-month [free quota](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-codespaces#free-quota) is generous.  Codespaces is free under the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack#github-codespaces).

### Codespaces Tips

* Codespaces keep running even when you close your browser (but will time out and stop after a while)
* Unless you're on a free plan, or within your free quota, costs acrue while the codespace is running, whether or not you have it open in your browser or are working on it
* You can control when it's running, and the space it takes up.  Check out [GitHub's codespaces lifecycle documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/about-codespaces/understanding-the-codespace-lifecycle)

## Sync Updates 
To make sure your personal forked repository stays up to date with the original class repository, please follow these steps:
1. Open your forked repo.
2. At the top of the page, you should see a banner or menu option that shows whether your fork is behind the original repo.
3. Click the **Sync fork** button.
4. In the dropdown, choose **Update branch** to pull the latest changes from the original repo into your fork.

Optionally, you can also follow these steps to create a new branch on your fork:
1. Open your **forked repository** on GitHub.  
2. At the top of the page, next to the branch dropdown, click the **Branches** button.  
3. In the **Branches** view, click the green **New Branch** button.  
4. In the popup window, enter a branch name.  
   - You can use any name you like, but it’s recommended to match the branch name used in class for better organization.  
5. Under **Branch source**, select:  
   - **Repository:** `AyhamB/INFO-5940-Codespace`  
   - **Branch:** choose the branch you want to sync from (e.g., `streamlit`).  
6. Click the green **Create New Branch** button.  
7. Verify that you’re now back in **your fork**, on the new branch you just created.  
8. Click the **Code** button and create a new Codespace (if you don’t already have one).  
   - Make sure the Codespace is created from the **current branch**.
  
## Running a Streamlit App on Codespaces  
Follow these steps to launch and view your Streamlit app in GitHub Codespaces:
1. **Open the terminal** inside your Codespace.
2. Run the command:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run your-file-name.py
   ```  
   **(Replace `your-file-name.py` with the actual name of your Streamlit app file, e.g., `hello_app.py`.)**
3. After pressing **Enter**, a popup should appear in the bottom-right corner of Codespace editor.  
   - Click **“Open in Browser”** to view your app.  

   ⚠️ *If you miss the popup:*  
   - Press **Ctrl + C** in the terminal to stop the app.  
   - Rerun the command from step 2 — the popup should appear again.
4. A new browser tab will open, showing the interface of your Streamlit app.
5. **Make changes to your code** in the Codespace editor.  
   - Refresh the browser tab to see the updated version of your app.  

## Setting Your API Key in GH Codespaces
You will receive an individual API Key for class assignments. To prevent accidental exposure online, please follow the steps below to securely insert your key in the terminal.
1. **Open the terminal** inside your Codespace.
2. Run the command to temporarily set your API Key for this session:  
   ```bash
   export API_KEY="your_actual_API_KEY"
   ```
3. If you want to run the Streamlit app and set up the key at the same time, run both commands together:
   ```bash
   API_KEY="your_actual_API_KEY" streamlit run your-file-name.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting
- The Jupyter extension should install automatically. If you still cannot select a Python kernel on Jupyter Notebook: Go to the left sidebar >> **Extensions** >> search for **Jupyter** >> reload window (or reinstall it).   



## HW1 Instructions, Overview, Documentation on Application

This is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that allows users to upload documents and interact with their content through a conversational chat interface.

**Key Features:**
Multiple Document Upload: Upload multiple .txt and .pdf files at once
Document Chunking: Automatically splits large documents into smaller chunks (1000 characters with 200 character overlap) for efficient processing
Vector-Based Retrieval: Uses ChromaDB with HuggingFace (LangChain) embeddings to find relevant content
Conversational Interface: Chat-style interface with conversation history
PDF Support: Extracts and processes text from PDF documents
RAG Pipeline: Retrieves relevant document chunks and generates accurate, context-aware answers

**Instructions for Running the Application**

The .devcontainer configuration will automatically set up the Python environment
Dependencies will install automatically via postCreateCommand

First need to install sentence-transformers and chromadb. In the terminal run 'pip install sentence-transformers' and 'pip install chromadb' as these were not included in requirements.txt (or need updated version) and are used in my application.

Run the application using this command in the terminal:

API_KEY="your_actual_API_KEY" streamlit run chat_with_pdf.py

Replace your_actual_API_KEY with your Cornell AI API key
The application will open in your browser once you click on the green button in the lower right corner of screen


**Interacting with the application:**

Click "Browse files" to upload .txt or .pdf files (multiple files supported)
Wait for "✅ Processed X document(s)!" confirmation
Type questions in the chat input and press Enter
Ask follow-up questions; the system remembers conversation context



**Configuration Changes**
Modified requirements.txt
Added two dependencies to support RAG functionality:

chromadb - Vector database for document storage and retrieval
sentence-transformers - For generating document embeddings using HuggingFace (LangChain) models

All other dependencies were already included in the provided requirements.txt file.
.devcontainer/devcontainer.json
No modifications were made. The provided devcontainer configuration works with the application as-is.
